### Hello, fellow geeks 🖖🏼

My name is Morgan Bell and I'm focused on improving developer's experiences building Twitter's core platform.

My preffered title is *professional geek*, but just saying I'm a product manager will suffice as well.

I'm a 🐶 mom x3, fantasy 🏈 champ, 🚀 geek, INFJ-A, and proud Gryffindor!
